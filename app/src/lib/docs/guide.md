## ownership 🗝

the [erc 721](http://erc721.org/) standard enables provable ownership of lemmas (words and phrases). an [erc 721](http://erc721.org/) token is a Non-Fungible Token (NFT). when you coin a new word on the lexiconomy, a NFT is minted and you have full ownership of it. 

as the owner of a word or phrase, you have the power to **define** it and **trade** it. ownership extends beyond the lexiconomy, you can use your lemmas in any NFT compatible application! lexiconomy lemmas are trade-able on opensea, rarible, and many other NFT marketplaces.

## inventing a word or phrase 💭

have a word or phrase in mind? search it for it and see if it exists. if the word exists, you'll see it's definition, example usage, and nft metadata. if the word doesn't exist, you have to the opportunity to coin it!

to coin a new word or phrase, give it a definition, an example of how its used, and click the mint button. after clicking mint, you'll have to connect to your wallet provider (Metamask, Rainbow, etc) to approve the transaction. once the transaction is confirmed, you'll be the provable owner of an NFT representing the word or phrase.

## definitions and examples 📝

all definitions and examples in the lexiconomy are user created. definitions and example are incorporated into the lemma's NFT description. a lemma’s definition or example can only be defined by their owner. the NFT will always show the latest definition and example; however, every new definition and example are recorded as an event on the the ethereum blockchain. this immutable event log depicts the evolution of the word and it's meaning over time.

## unicode support 😎

thanks to the [Unicode Ethereum Project](https://github.com/devstein/unicode-eth), the lexiconomy is able to support unicode characters.

## illegal lemmas 🚨

if you've read this far, you’ve probably noticed that only lowercase letters are allowed in the lexiconomy! this is to protect owners from others duplicating their lemmas with different casing. in the same vein, there are a few other rules enforced on the lexiconomy:

-   no uppercase letters
-   no trailing whitespace
-   only single spaces allowed between words and punctuation

## web3 (issues) 🤕

the lexiconomy is built entirely on ethereum! all of the lexiconomy's data is decentralized and stored on the ethereum network.

this is an incredible accomplishment, but decentralized applications are not a fully matured technology and you may noticed inconsistent loading times and temporary data reliability issue.

if you encounter missing data or long loading times, practice patience and **refresh your page** a few times until the issue is fixed.

## looking for the lexiconomy v1? 📜 

The original lexiconomy has been moved to [v1.lexiconomy.org](https://v1.lexiconomy.org). all tokens minted in the original lexiconomy have been airdropped to their respective owners in the v2 contract.
